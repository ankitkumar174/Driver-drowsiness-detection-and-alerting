## About Driver drowsiness detection and alerting system

Created a Driver drowsiness Detection system with computer vision and deep learning. This system help to prevent the accidents happen due to drowsiness of the driver by alerting them. Trained by a pipeline of convolutional neural network. Test this model on live camera using Computer Vision.

## Aim

With this Python project, we will be making a drowsiness detection system. A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive when feeling sleepy.

The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy. 

## Built With

* Python
* OpenCV
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* Pygame
